## üöÄ Introduction
PhysioSync is a pre-training framework for EEG-based emotion recognition that leverages **temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning** inspired by physiological synchronization.  
It incorporates **Cross-Modal Consistency Alignment (CM-CA)** to capture dynamic relationships between EEG and Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS), and **Long- and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning (LS-TCL)** to model emotional fluctuations across different time resolutions.  
Experiments on **DEAP** and **DREAMER** demonstrate that PhysioSync achieves robust improvements in both uni-modal and cross-modal settings.

## üì¶Create environment

We recommend Python >= 3.8.

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Alternatively, if you use conda:)

```bash
conda create -n physiosync python=3.9
conda activate physiosync
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìä Dataset
We evaluate PhysioSync on benchmark EEG-based emotion recognition datasets.
Please download the datasets from their official sources
- [DEAP](https://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/)
- [DREAMER](https://zenodo.org/records/546113)


## üèÉPre-training and Fine-tuning
Take DEAP's "Dependent" as an example

### Training
```bash
python main_pretrain_1s.py
python main_pretrain_5s.py
```
### Fine-tuning

```bash
cd Fine_tuning
python fine_tuning.py 
```
